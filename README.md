I’m a Web Developer with a passion for building scalable and user-friendly applications. I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and have experience working on real-world projects that solve real-life problems.

I’m also skilled in:

Frontend Development: React, Tailwind CSS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Backend Development: PHP (Laravel), Node.js
CMS Platforms: WordPress and custom plugins
Currently, I’m:
🌱 Exploring TypeScript and Python to enhance my skills
🔨 Building projects that merge creativity with functionality
🤝 Collaborating with teams to deliver impactful solutions

When I’m not coding, you can find me learning new technologies, attending community meetups, or contributing to open-source projects. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you’d like to collaborate!

Skills: HTML/CSS/JS/C/C++/PYTHON/REACT/NODE

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Wordpress Plugin Development
